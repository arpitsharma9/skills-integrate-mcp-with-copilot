# Advanced Statistics for Activities

Add a feature to calculate and display advanced statistics for each activity, such as:
- Player or participant contributions (e.g., for sports teams)
- Custom metrics (e.g., attendance, performance, improvement)
- Visualizations (charts, graphs)

This will help teachers and students better understand participation and outcomes.
